## Group H 
Here there is the code implemented to do the final project work of Quantitative Models for Economics Analysis and Management in Sapienza University of Rome (2019-2020). 

Group H: FÃ©licie Bizeul, Mathieu Grasland, Roberta Passarelli, Francesca Porcu. 

The goal of this project is to do some detailed quality analysis of the data taken from the European Tertiary Education Register (ETER) and Eurostat, with a particual focus on gender share in research, ISCED 8. We analyse this topic in threee Mediterranean countries, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and three Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Finland and Norway. 

The file `data_quality_analysis.ipynb` provides the code to the data quality dimensions of the data from ETER: timeliness, accuracy, completeness and consistency. Follows the file `multiannual_check.ipynb` with the multiannual analysis of the data and the `Ratios.ipynb` file with the analysis of the ratio. `R&D analysis.ipynb` contains with the analysis of the expenditure.
